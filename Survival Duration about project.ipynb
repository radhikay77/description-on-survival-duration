    "## Project Description\n",
    "The Survival Duration Calculator is a simple Python program that calculates how long a person has lived in various time units, such as months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- Accepts age in years as input.\n",
    "- Allows the user to choose from six different time units for calculation.\n",
    "- Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thought Process\n",
    "1. Simplify the problem into manageable steps.\n",
    "2. Use functions to make the code reusable and modular.\n",
    "3. Handle edge cases, such as invalid inputs and negative age."
